This was a project that was built based off the article published on Machine Learning Mastery by Jason Brownlee Ph.D
I utilized a dataset containing the last 30 days of power demand data in California and transformed the raw data to be indexed by a datetime column.

**TAKEAWAY:**
**The RMSE score is not good and this has led me to tinkering with the parameters of the model and trying different amounts of neurons in the model. This is still a work in progress but it shows the application
of a cookie cutter LSTM approach on a publicly available powergrid data set. **
